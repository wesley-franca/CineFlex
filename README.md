<h1>CineFlex</h1>

<h2>A single page aplication made to emulate a movie theater web site where the user could choose a movie, schedule a day to watch it and choose between the avaiable seats to make the reservation.</h2>

  
<h2>One of the projects I felt the most the result of my study because it was the first time I was consuming an API (through axios library) to display the content and save the new data, treating errors and dealing with the API responding time.</h2>

<h3>I recently noticed the API is not working that well anymore... I need to create a new one to replace this one I get, and maybe refactor everything in this aplication</h3>
